                        suzerain Build Procedure
                    ===============================

0. Introduction
---------------

This document describes how to build Suzerain from source code on Unix-like
systems.  For information on the numerics, please see the model documents
under writeups/ that are built when a LaTeX installation is available.


1. Dependencies
---------------

The code depends upon the following libraries:

    1) GNU Scientific Library (GSL) from http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
    2) FFTW from http://www.fftw.org/ compiled with MPI support
    3) Boost from http://www.boost.org/
    4) Eigen from http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/
    5) Apache Log4cxx from http://logging.apache.org/log4cxx/
    6) ESIO from https://github.com/RhysU/ESIO

The following optional dependencies are recommended for full functionality:

    1) GRVY from https://red.ices.utexas.edu/projects/software/wiki/GRVY
    2) SymPy from http://sympy.org
    3) Antioch from https://github.com/libantioch/antioch
    4) underling from https://red.ices.utexas.edu/projects/underling


2. Configuration
----------------

If you have no `configure' script in the top level directory, run `bootstrap'
to create one using GNU autoconf and automake.  Using bootstrap will require a
recent version of autoconf, automake, and pkg-config's pkg.m4 macros.

Before compiling suzerain, you need to run the provided `configure' script.
Generally, just `./configure' will work, but you may wish to provide more
parameters.  Run `./configure --help' for details.


3. Compilation
--------------

To compile suzerain after it has been configured, simply type 'make'.

After the compilation one or more ready-to-use executables should reside in the
src directory.  Related documentation will be built in the doc subdirectory.


4. Testing
--------------

Automated tests can be compiled and run using 'make check'.


5. Attribution
--------------
