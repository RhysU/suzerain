                        suzerain Build Procedure
                    ===============================

0. Introduction
---------------

This document describes how to build suzerain from source code on
Unix-like systems.


1. Dependencies
---------------

The code depends upon the following libraries:

    1) GNU Scientific Library (GSL) from http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
    2) Boost from http://www.boost.org/


2. Configuration
----------------

If you have no `configure' script in the top level directory, run
`bootstrap' to create one using GNU autoconf and automake.

Before compiling suzerain, you need to run the provided `configure'
script.  Generally, just `./configure' will work, but you may wish to
provide more parameters.  Run `./configure --help' for details.


3. Compilation
--------------

To compile suzerain after it has been configured, simply type 'make'.

After the compilation one or more ready-to-use executables should reside
in the src directory.  Related documentation will be built in the doc
subdirectory.


4. Testing
--------------

Unit tests can be compiled and run using 'make check'.
