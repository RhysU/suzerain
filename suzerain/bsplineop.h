/** @file
 * Provides B-spline-based banded operator construction and application
 * routines.  Both real- and complex- valued operator application and inversion
 * are supported.  The derivative operators map a function's spline
 * coefficients to an approximation of the derivative's spline coefficients.
 *
 * For collocation-based operators, the approximation \f$\tilde{\gamma}(x) =
 * \sum_{i} \beta_{i} B_{i}(x)\f$ to the continuous operator
 * \f$\mathcal{D}\f$ acting on
 * \f$\tilde{\phi}(x) = \sum_{i} \alpha_{i} B_{i}(x)\f$ must satisfy
 * \f$\tilde{\gamma}(x_j) = \left(\mathcal{D}\tilde{\phi}\right)(x_j)\f$
 * at each collocation point \f$x_j\f$.  This implies
 * \f[
 *        \sum_{i} \beta_{i} B_{i}(x_j)
 *      = \sum_{i} \alpha_{i} \mathcal{D}(B_i)(x_j)
 *      \quad \forall{} j.
 * \f]
 * The \f$k\f$-th collocation derivative operator matrix is given by
 * \f$D^k_{i,j}=\left(B^{(k)}_j(x_i)\right)\f$.  Conveniently, the
 * matrix-vector product of a collocation derivative matrix with a B-spline
 * coefficient vector is equivalent to evaluating the linear combination of the
 * basis functions at the collocation points.
 *
 * For Galerkin-based operators, the relationship \f$ \left( B_j,
 * \tilde{\gamma}\right) = \left(B_j, \mathcal{D}\tilde{\phi}\right)\f$ must
 * hold for each spline basis index \f$j\f$ where \f$(f,g)\f$ denotes the
 * \f$L_2\f$ inner product.  This implies
 * \f[
 *          \sum_{i} \beta_{i} \left( B_j, B_i \right)
 *      =   \sum_{i} \alpha_{j} \left( B_j, \mathcal{D}B_i \right).
 * \f]
 * The \f$k\f$-th Galerkin derivative operator matrix is given by
 * \f$D^k_{i,j}=\left(B_j,B^{(k)}_i\right)\f$.  For either method, applying
 * the \f$k\f$-th derivative operator requires solving the linear problem
 * \f$D^{0} \beta = D^{k} \alpha\f$.  The method to use is chosen
 * through the ::suzerain_bsplineop_method value provided to
 * suzerain_bsplineop_alloc().
 *
 * All operator matrices are stored \e transposed in column-major (Fortran)
 * storage.  The operator transposes are stored so that discrete operator
 * application (which is nothing but a matrix-vector product) has an optimal
 * memory access pattern.  Multiple threads may call the routines
 * simultaneously provided that each thread has its own workspace instances.
 * The behavior is undefined if two threads simultaneously share a workspace.
 * Internally, the code builds upon the <a
 * href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GNU Scientific Library</a> (GSL) <a
 * href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/Basis-Splines.html">
 * B-spline routines</a> and uses banded matrix BLAS and LAPACK functionality
 * where possible.
