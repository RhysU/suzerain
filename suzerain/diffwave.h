 * differentiation of the X and Z directions is supported.  Additional padding
 * (e.g. due to dealiasing) may be present and will be zeroed during

/**
 * Given a complex-valued, wave-space field \f$x\f$, compute \f$ x \leftarrow{}
 * \alpha \partial{}x^{\mbox{dxcnt}} \partial{}z^{\mbox{dzcnt}} x\f$.  The
 * implementation accounts for the field potentially being dealiased,
 * distributed across multiple machines, and representing a domain of arbitrary
 * length in the X and Z directions.  This routine may also be used to
 * efficiently zero higher wavenumbers used only for dealiasing when <tt>dxcnt
 * == 0</tt>, <tt>dzcnt == 0</tt> (where usually \f$\alpha = 1\f$).  All
 * Nyquist modes \e are zeroed when <tt>dxcnt == 0</tt>, <tt>dzcnt == 0</tt>.
 *
 * The input and output data \c x is stored column-major over the Y direction
 * (index range <tt>0</tt> to <tt>Ny-1</tt>), X direction (index range
 * <tt>dkbx</tt> to <tt>dkex</tt>), and Z direction (index range <tt>dkbz</tt>
 * to <tt>dkez</tt>).  This layout is equivalent to Dmitry Pekurovsky's P3DFFT
 * storage order when Y is specified to be STRIDE1 in wave space.  Complex
 * values are stored as C arrays of length two with the real part preceding
 * the imaginary part.
