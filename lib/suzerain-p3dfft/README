Features
------------

    * Parallel implementation of 3D FFT with 2D (a.k.a. pencils) data 
decomposition, overcoming an important limitation to scalability of other 
3D FFT libraries implementing 1D, or slab, decomposition.
    * Optimized for parallel communication and single-CPU performance.
    * Uses established libraries (FFTW, ESSL) for underlying local 1D FFT. 
    * Fortran and C interfaces.
    * Extra feature: ghost cells for nearest-neighbor communication 
      support (halo send-receive).

The 1D decomposition suffers from the limitation that the number
of processors used cannot be greater than the maximum linear grid size of the 
cubic domain to be processed. With the 2D domain decomposition scheme 
the maximum number of processors is significantly higher, equal to the 
square of the linear grid size. 

This library is especially suited for large-data-volume applications on ultra-scale
parallel platforms. 

------------
Machine requirements
------------

This library is built on top of an externally provided 1D FFT library. 
Current choices are ESSL (for IBM systems) or FFTW. Either one of these 
libraries must be installed on the system in order to use P3DFFT.
The choice of the library is specified at compile time. 

P3DFFT is written in Fortran 90 with MPI. Having an Fortran90/MPI compiler
is essential to building the library on your system. C interface is 
provided. 

------------
Directory structure
------------

build/
  The library files are contained here. Building the library is required 
  before it can be used. Enter this directory, create/modify 'makeinc'
  suitable for your architecture, and type 'make'. For more instructions
  on building the library see file install.txt
sample/
  This directory has example programs in both FORTRAN and C, in 
  separate subdirectories. Enter this directory, modify 'makeinc'
  and type 'make' to create test executables. Tests provided include
  out-of-place and in-place transforms 3D FFT, with error checking. 
  Also provided is an example of power spectrum calculation. 
include/ 
  The library is provided as a Fortran module. 
  After installation this directory will have p3dfft.mod for Fortran interface
  and p3dfft.h, the C wrapper/include file. Be sure to specify 
  -I/your/p3dfft_root/include when compiling your programs. 
lib/
  The library archive libp3dfft.a will be installed here upon successful 
  completion of the build. Be sure to specify -L/your/p3dfft_root/lib -lp3dfft
  when linking your executable.
