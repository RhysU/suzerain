/*! \page installation Installation

Largo uses the GNU autotools suite (autoconf, automake, and libtool) for its
development build system.  This system is popular among the Linux development
community and provides a familiar build environment for end users.

To build Largo starting from a release distribution, untar the distribution and
enter the top-level directory.

\code
 > tar xvfz largo-$(VERSION).tar.gz
 > cd largo-$(VERSION)/
\endcode

<h2>Configuration Requirements</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>GNU Make</dt>
  <dd>You must have <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU
      Make</a> installed as largo's build system relies on many GNU
      extensions.
  </dd>
  <dt>Compilers</dt>
  <dd>You must have a working C and Fortran 90 compiler from the
      same vendor.  Currently the GNU (<tt>gcc</tt>/<tt>gfortran</tt>)
      and Intel (<tt>icc</tt>/<tt>ifort</tt>) compilers are supported. If
      largo's configure script cannot automatically detect the correct
      compiler location, try setting \$CC and \$FC environment
      variables prior to running configure.
  </dd>
</dl>

To configure largo, within the largo-$(VERSION) directory issue
\code
 > ./configure
\endcode
where you should add any additional configure options at the end of
the command.  One very useful option is the <code>--prefix=DIR</code>
which sets your desired top-level installation directory for largo.

By default, largo builds both a shared and static library (for example,
<tt>liblargo.so</tt> and <tt>liblargo.a</tt>, respectively).

<h2> Library Build </h2>

Once configured, issue a <tt>make</tt> to build the software. If successful,
this will build the largo library (static and dynamic versions), several
examples, and some additional largo-related utilities.

\code > make \endcode

If you see error messages regarding <tt>-fPIC</tt>, see the above configuration
hints regarding building shared versus static versions of largo.

<h2> Build Verification (Optional) </h2>

To optionally verify that the software is working properly, a check target is
provided to run a suite of functionality tests against the local build.  To run
these tests, issue

\code > make check \endcode

<h2> Installation </h2>

After the build is complete, issue

\code > make install \endcode

to install the library.  The installation will consist of three top-level
directories housing largo's include files, compiled libraries, and utilities.
