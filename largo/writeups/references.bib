@phdthesis{Kwok2002,
    abstract = {Turbulent mixing layers exhibit striking compressibility
effects. In particular, at modest Mach numbers, the growth rate of compressible
mixing layers is significantly reduced from that of incompressible mixing
layers. In this research, the relationship of this growth rate reduction to the
commonly observed large-scale structures in the mixing layer is investigated.
This goal is accomplished by performing direct numerical simulations of
compressible time-developing mixing layers. Two fields from the fully developed
incompressible mixing-layer simulations of Rogers and Moser are used to
construct initial conditions, one from the natural (unforced) simulation and
one from the 'strongly forced' simulation, which has much more prominent
two-dimensional mixing-layer structures. Cases were run at convective Mach
numbers of 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2. It is found that significant compressible growth
rate reductions occur only in the cases in which two-dimensional flow
structures are prevalent. Flow visualization reveals that large spanwise
vortices are stretched and pairing is suppressed, leading to a reduction in
mixing layer growth. Structural change of large-scale structures induces a
decrease in cross-stream velocity fluctuations, Reynolds shear stress, and
magnitude of pressure fluctuations, consistent with the growth suppression
mechanism proposed by Vreman et al. and Freund et al. Direct numerical
simulations of turbulent flows require numerical schemes with high resolution
and grid flexibility. Resolution properties of B-spline and compact
finite-difference schemes are evaluated using Fourier analysis in periodic
domains, and tests based on solution of the wave and heat equations in finite
domains, with uniform and non-uniform grids. Results show that compact
finite-difference schemes have a higher convergence rate and in some cases
better resolution on uniform grids. However, B-spline schemes have more
consistent behavior on non-uniform grids, and a more straightforward and robust
formulation.},

@phdthesis{Guarini1998,
    abstract = {The objectives of this research were to develop a method by
which the spatially developing compressible turbulent boundary layer could be
simulated using a temporally developing numerical simulation and to study the
physics of the compressible turbulent boundary layer. We take advantage of the
technique developed by Spalart (1987, 1988) for the incompressible case. In
this technique, it is recognized that the boundary layer exhibits slow growth
in the streamwise direction, so the turbulence can be treated as approximately
homogeneous in this direction. The slow growth is accounted for with a
coordinate transformation and a multiple scale analysis. The result is a
modified system of equations (Navier-Stokes plus some extra terms, which we
call "slow growth terms") that are homogeneous in both the streamwise and
spanwise directions and represent the state of the boundary layer at a given
streamwise location (or, equivalently, a given thickness). The compressible
Navier-Stokes equations are solved using a mixed Fourier and B-spline
"spectral" method. The dependent variables are expanded in terms of a Fourier
representation in the horizontal directions and a B-spline representation in
the wall-normal direction. In the wall-normal direction non-reflecting boundary
conditions are used at the freestream boundary, and zero-heat-flux no-slip
boundary conditions are used at the wall. This combination of splines and
Fourier methods produces a very accurate numerical method. Mixed
implicit/explicit time discretization is used. Results are presented for a case
with a Mach number of 2.5, and a Reynolds number, based on momentum integral
thickness and wall viscosity, of \\\\$R\\\\sb{\\\\theta\\\\sp\\\\prime}\\\\$ =
840. The results show that the van Driest transformed velocity satisfies the
incompressible scalings and a narrow logarithmic region is obtained. The
results for the turbulence intensities compare well with the incompressible
simulations of Spalart. Pressure fluctuations are found to be higher than in
incompressible flow. Morkovin's strong Reynolds analogy does not agree with the
results of the simulation, however, an analogy is found between the rate of
turbulent heat transfer and the rate of turbulent momentum transfer. Reynolds
stress and turbulent kinetic energy budgets are computed and compared with the
budgets from Spalart's incompressible simulations.},

@phdthesis{Venugopal2003,
    abstract = {Core flow in a solid propellant rocket motor is often modeled
as the injection driven flow in a chamber closed at the head end. However, it
becomes expensive to conduct direct numerical simulations in this configuration
at moderately high Reynolds numbers. In the current study, a simplified model
for the core flow in a solid rocket motor has been devised that allows direct
numerical simulations to be conducted at a reasonable cost. In the simplified
model problem, the streamwise direction has been asymptotically homogenized by
assuming that at large distances from the head end of the rocket motor, both
the mean and {RMS} of turbulent fluctuations evolve slowly in the streamwise
direction. The {Navier-Stokes} equations are then modified to account for this
slow growth. Using the simplified model, a separate direct numerical simulation
can now be conducted at each streamwise location in the rocket motor. A direct
numerical simulation of compressible turbulent flow in the model rocket has
been conducted at a streamwise location situated 40 channel half-widths from
the head end of the rocket motor and at an injection Reynolds number of
approximately 190. The simulation reveals that turbulence results in increased
near wall gradients for streamwise velocity, density and temperature due to the
presence of the Reynolds stress term. The turbulence in the model rocket is
found to be only weakly compressible, although significant compressibility
existed in the mean flow. Streaks, streamwise vortices and inclined shear
layers are observed in the near wall region. The vorticity vector shows a
preference to be inclined at (39°-49°) to the wall, similar to observations
made in non-transpired channel flows. The direct numerical simulation database
is also used to make a priori estimates of the relative magnitudes of subgrid
terms in the filtered evolution equations. It is found that in the equations
for mean momentum and resolved scale Reynolds stress, the dominant subgrid
terms are the subgrid stress terms. The contribution of subgrid stress to wall
normal transport and dissipation in the resolved scale turbulent kinetic energy
equation are similar to those observed in turbulent channel flows.},

    abstract = {Two numerical methods were designed to solve the time-dependent, three-dimensional, incompressible Naveir-Stokes equations in boundary layers (method A, semi-infinite domain) and mixing layers or wakes (method B, fully-infinite domain). Their originality lies in the use of rapidly-decaying spectral basis functions to approximated the vertical dependence of the solutions, combined with one method A) or two (method B) slowly-decaying "extra functions" for each wave-vector that exactly represent the irrotational componetnt of the solution at large distances. Both methods eliminate the pressure term as part of the formulation, thus avoiding fractional-step time integration. They yield rapid convergence and are free of spurious modes in the Orr-Sommerfeld spectra. They are also efficient, although the operation count is of order N^2 (N is the number of modes in the infinite direction). These methods have been used for extensive direct numerical simulations of transition and turbulence. A new time-integration scheme, with low storage requirements and good stability properties, is also described.},

@article{Coleman1995Numerical,
    abstract = {{A study of compressible supersonic turbulent flow in a plane channel with isothermal walls has been performed using direct numerical simulation. Mach numbers, based on the bulk velocity and sound speed at the walls, of 1.5 and 3 are considered; Reynolds numbers, defined in terms of the centreline velocity and channel half-width, are of the order of 3000. Because of the relatively low Reynolds number, all of the relevant scales of motion can be captured, and no subgrid-scale or turbulence model is needed. The isothermal boundary conditions give rise to a flow that is strongly influenced by wall-normal gradients of mean density and temperature. These gradients are found to cause an enhanced streamwise coherence of the near-wall streaks, but not to seriously invalidate Morkovin\&apos;s hypothesis : the magnitude of fluctuations of total temperature and especially pressure are much less than their mean values, and consequently the dominant compressibility effect is that due to mean property variations. The Van Driest transformation is found to be very successful at both Mach numbers, and when properly scaled, statistics are found to agree well with data from incompressible channel flow results.}},
