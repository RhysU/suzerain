# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_WITH_PERL([VALUE-IF-NOT-FOUND],[PATH])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Locates an installed Perl binary, placing the result in the precious
#   variable $PERL. Accepts a present $PERL, then --with-perl, and failing
#   that searches for perl in the given path (which defaults to the system
#   path). If perl is found, $PERL is set to the full path of the binary; if
#   it is not found $PERL is set to VALUE-IF-NOT-FOUND if provided,
#   unchanged otherwise.
#
#   A typical use could be the following one:
#
#         AX_WITH_PERL
