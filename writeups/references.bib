@phdthesis{Kwok2002,
    abstract = {Turbulent mixing layers exhibit striking compressibility
effects. In particular, at modest Mach numbers, the growth rate of compressible
mixing layers is significantly reduced from that of incompressible mixing
layers. In this research, the relationship of this growth rate reduction to the
commonly observed large-scale structures in the mixing layer is investigated.
This goal is accomplished by performing direct numerical simulations of
compressible time-developing mixing layers. Two fields from the fully developed
incompressible mixing-layer simulations of Rogers and Moser are used to
construct initial conditions, one from the natural (unforced) simulation and
one from the 'strongly forced' simulation, which has much more prominent
two-dimensional mixing-layer structures. Cases were run at convective Mach
numbers of 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2. It is found that significant compressible growth
rate reductions occur only in the cases in which two-dimensional flow
structures are prevalent. Flow visualization reveals that large spanwise
vortices are stretched and pairing is suppressed, leading to a reduction in
mixing layer growth. Structural change of large-scale structures induces a
decrease in cross-stream velocity fluctuations, Reynolds shear stress, and
magnitude of pressure fluctuations, consistent with the growth suppression
mechanism proposed by Vreman et al. and Freund et al. Direct numerical
simulations of turbulent flows require numerical schemes with high resolution
and grid flexibility. Resolution properties of B-spline and compact
finite-difference schemes are evaluated using Fourier analysis in periodic
domains, and tests based on solution of the wave and heat equations in finite
domains, with uniform and non-uniform grids. Results show that compact
finite-difference schemes have a higher convergence rate and in some cases
better resolution on uniform grids. However, B-spline schemes have more
consistent behavior on non-uniform grids, and a more straightforward and robust
formulation.},

@phdthesis{Guarini1998,
    abstract = {The objectives of this research were to develop a method by
which the spatially developing compressible turbulent boundary layer could be
simulated using a temporally developing numerical simulation and to study the
physics of the compressible turbulent boundary layer. We take advantage of the
technique developed by Spalart (1987, 1988) for the incompressible case. In
this technique, it is recognized that the boundary layer exhibits slow growth
in the streamwise direction, so the turbulence can be treated as approximately
homogeneous in this direction. The slow growth is accounted for with a
coordinate transformation and a multiple scale analysis. The result is a
modified system of equations (Navier-Stokes plus some extra terms, which we
call "slow growth terms") that are homogeneous in both the streamwise and
spanwise directions and represent the state of the boundary layer at a given
streamwise location (or, equivalently, a given thickness). The compressible
Navier-Stokes equations are solved using a mixed Fourier and B-spline
"spectral" method. The dependent variables are expanded in terms of a Fourier
representation in the horizontal directions and a B-spline representation in
the wall-normal direction. In the wall-normal direction non-reflecting boundary
conditions are used at the freestream boundary, and zero-heat-flux no-slip
boundary conditions are used at the wall. This combination of splines and
Fourier methods produces a very accurate numerical method. Mixed
implicit/explicit time discretization is used. Results are presented for a case
with a Mach number of 2.5, and a Reynolds number, based on momentum integral
thickness and wall viscosity, of \\\\$R\\\\sb{\\\\theta\\\\sp\\\\prime}\\\\$ =
840. The results show that the van Driest transformed velocity satisfies the
incompressible scalings and a narrow logarithmic region is obtained. The
results for the turbulence intensities compare well with the incompressible
simulations of Spalart. Pressure fluctuations are found to be higher than in
incompressible flow. Morkovin's strong Reynolds analogy does not agree with the
results of the simulation, however, an analogy is found between the rate of
turbulent heat transfer and the rate of turbulent momentum transfer. Reynolds
stress and turbulent kinetic energy budgets are computed and compared with the
budgets from Spalart's incompressible simulations.},

@phdthesis{Venugopal2003,
    abstract = {Core flow in a solid propellant rocket motor is often modeled
as the injection driven flow in a chamber closed at the head end. However, it
becomes expensive to conduct direct numerical simulations in this configuration
at moderately high Reynolds numbers. In the current study, a simplified model
for the core flow in a solid rocket motor has been devised that allows direct
numerical simulations to be conducted at a reasonable cost. In the simplified
model problem, the streamwise direction has been asymptotically homogenized by
assuming that at large distances from the head end of the rocket motor, both
the mean and {RMS} of turbulent fluctuations evolve slowly in the streamwise
direction. The {Navier-Stokes} equations are then modified to account for this
slow growth. Using the simplified model, a separate direct numerical simulation
can now be conducted at each streamwise location in the rocket motor. A direct
numerical simulation of compressible turbulent flow in the model rocket has
been conducted at a streamwise location situated 40 channel half-widths from
the head end of the rocket motor and at an injection Reynolds number of
approximately 190. The simulation reveals that turbulence results in increased
near wall gradients for streamwise velocity, density and temperature due to the
presence of the Reynolds stress term. The turbulence in the model rocket is
found to be only weakly compressible, although significant compressibility
existed in the mean flow. Streaks, streamwise vortices and inclined shear
layers are observed in the near wall region. The vorticity vector shows a
preference to be inclined at (39°-49°) to the wall, similar to observations
made in non-transpired channel flows. The direct numerical simulation database
is also used to make a priori estimates of the relative magnitudes of subgrid
terms in the filtered evolution equations. It is found that in the equations
for mean momentum and resolved scale Reynolds stress, the dominant subgrid
terms are the subgrid stress terms. The contribution of subgrid stress to wall
normal transport and dissipation in the resolved scale turbulent kinetic energy
equation are similar to those observed in turbulent channel flows.},

spurious modes in the Orr-Sommerfeld spectra. They are also efficient, although
the operation count is of order N^2 (N is the number of modes in the infinite

channel with isothermal walls has been performed using direct numerical
simulation. Mach numbers, based on the bulk velocity and sound speed at the

centreline velocity and channel half-width, are of the order of 3000. Because
of the relatively low Reynolds number, all of the relevant scales of motion can
be captured, and no subgrid-scale or turbulence model is needed. The isothermal
boundary conditions give rise to a flow that is strongly influenced by
wall-normal gradients of mean density and temperature. These gradients are
found to cause an enhanced streamwise coherence of the near-wall streaks, but
not to seriously invalidate Morkovin's hypothesis : the magnitude of
fluctuations of total temperature and especially pressure are much less than
their mean values, and consequently the dominant compressibility effect is that
due to mean property variations. The Van Driest transformation is found to be
very successful at both Mach numbers, and when properly scaled, statistics are
found to agree well with data from incompressible channel flow results.}},

large-scale motions, and the latter to the scaling of the pressure itself. It
is also found that the pressure terms scale better near the wall when they are
not separated into their diffusion and deviatoric components, but mostly only
because the two terms tend to cancel each other in the viscous sublayer. The
budgets, together with their statistical uncertainties, are available

compatible with modern non-dissipative algorithms used for direct simulations
of turbulent flows. These methods have very low dispersion errors and require
precise boundary conditions to avoid numerical instabilities and to control
spurious wave reflections at the computational boundaries. The present
formulation is an attempt to provide such conditions. Reflecting and
non-reflecting boundary condition treatments are presented. Examples of
practical implementations for inlet and outlet boundaries as well as slip and
no-slip walls are presented. The method applies to subsonic and supersonic
flows. It is compared with a reference method based on extrapolation and
partial use of {Riemann} invariants. Test cases described include a ducted shear
layer, vortices propagating through boundaries, and Poiseuille flow. Although
no mathematical proof of well-posedness is given, the method uses the correct
number of boundary conditions required for well-posedness of the
{Navier--Stokes} equations and the examples reveal that it provides a
significant improvement over the reference method.},

@mastersthesis{Medida2007,
    abstract = {{In the present work, the Giles non-reflecting boundary
conditions have been extended to Curvilinear co-ordinates for wall-bounded
flows. In addition to the non-reflecting boundary conditions, wall boundary
conditions have been derived and implemented for inflow/outflow-wall corners
(grid points common to the inflow/outflow and wall boundaries) so that the flow
solution at the corner points satisfies both the inflow/outflow boundary
conditions and the wall boundary conditions. Two-dimensional, wall-bounded,
Ringleb flow configurations (with non-orthogonal grids and curved boundary
geometries) were used as test cases to validate the non-reflecting boundary
conditions and the wall corner conditions. The wall corner conditions for the
Cartesian Giles boundary conditions were sufficient to eliminate the flow
through wall at inflow and outflow corners. However, the Cartesian Giles
boundary conditions along with the wall corner conditions could not solve the
corner problem in the Ringleb flow test cases and eventually caused the flow
solution to diverge. Two-dimensional Curvilinear Giles boundary conditions
derived from the Curvilinear form of the linearized Euler equations resulted in
additional terms that were not present in the chain rule form of Cartesian
Giles boundary conditions. These additional terms contained the factor (xx +
yy) which becomes zero for an orthogonal grid. The Curvilinear Giles boundary
conditions, when implemented without the additional terms, displayed the same
corner problem that was encountered with the chain rule form of Cartesian Giles
boundary conditions, proving the significance of the additional orthogonal
terms. In order to completely eliminate flow through the wall and obtain the
correct solution at the corners, the Curvilinear boundary conditions with the
additional terms and the wall corner conditions were required. The Curvilinear
Giles boundary conditions along with the wall corner conditions were
successfully tested on various Ringleb flow geometries and grid densities.
However, a long-term instability was noticed for all the Ringleb flow
configurations beyond a certain number of grid points. This was eliminated by
stretching the grid towards the inflow and outflow boundaries. Converged
solutions were obtained for all the test cases with acceptable L2 errors.}},

dispersive nature of the discretized equations can lead to spurious numerical
reflections not seen in the continuous boundary value problem. Here we
construct discretely nonreflecting boundary conditions, which account for the
particular finite-difference scheme used, and are designed to minimize these
spurious numerical reflections. Stable boundary conditions that are local and
nonreflecting to arbitrarily high order of accuracy are obtained, and test
cases are presented for the linearized Euler equations. For the cases
presented, reflections for a pressure pulse leaving the boundary are reduced by
up to two orders of magnitude over typical ad hoc closures, and for a vorticity
pulse, reflections are reduced by up to four orders of magnitude.},

modification of the classical definition of the periodogram is necessary in
order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With
this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves
to the data are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the
periodogram are less important than commonly believed in the case of detection
of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating
these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if the sampling is
uneven. An analysis of the statistical significance of signal detections is
