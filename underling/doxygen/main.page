\section overview Overview

The underling library provides simple, scalable means to manipulate
MPI-parallel, three dimensional pencil decompositions using <a
href="http://www.fftw.org/"> FFTW</a>.  Pencil decompositions are a natural way
to distribute O(n^3) data across O(n^2) processors and are well-suited for
memory-intensive, structured spectral turbulence simulations and postprocessing
codes.  It may be useful in other domains as well.  The library is written in
C99 and may be used by C89 or C++ applications.

The underling library provides:
<ul>
  <li>In- and out-of-place pencil transposes built using FFTW MPI</li>
  <li>In- and out-of-place FFTs built atop the pencil transposes using FFTW</li>
  <li>FFTs allowing for up to two non-Fourier directions and one real-to-complex Fourier direction</li>
  <li>Documented, usable intermediate data storage allowing computation on partially transposed data</li>
  <li>Options for both reducing on-node data movement and contiguously packing results in memory</li>
  <li>Interleaving of multiple complex- or real-valued fields if so desired</li>
  <li>The ability to concurrently work with multiple pencil decompositions across one or more MPI communicators</li>
  <li>On-node multithreading for FFTs and data shuffling inherited from FFTW</li>
  <li>An out-of-the-box benchmarking tool for experimenting with the library</li>
  <li>Lots of warm fuzzy feelings because of a comprehensive test suite</li>
</ul>
