/*! \page benchmark Benchmarking

Underling provides an MPI-based benchmarking utility named \c underling_bench.

\c underling_bench is built and installed alongside the library.  It can plan
and perform various transpose and transform options to simplify measuring
performance and scalability on your favorite system.  It may also be used to
generate FFTW wisdom for specific problem sizes.  When underling is configured
to use GRVY (see \subpage installation), \c underling_bench provides much more
detailed performance information.  See <tt>underling_bench --help</tt> for more
details.
