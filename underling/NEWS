     * Feature #2054: Add underling_fwd.hpp and underling_fftw_fwd.hpp
     * Feature #2192: Remove program_options dependency from tests
     * Feature #2199: Roll underling 0.3.0 release

What's new in underling 0.2.1
-----------------------------

Updates to support FFTW 3.3's new side-by-side pthread and OpenMP builds:

     * Feature #1924: Allow parallel pthread/openmp build

New underling_bench features for benchmarking transposes plus FFT use cases:

     * Feature #1866: Add forward and backward transpose counts to underling_bench
     * Feature #1867: Add FFTs to underling_bench
     * Feature #1869: Ensure underling_bench not overly-linked
     * Feature #1870: Add lock to wisdom file for underling_bench
     * Feature #1901: Have a planning timeout for underling_bench
     * Feature #1902: Start underling_bench from long_n0

Miscellaneous items:

    * Feature #2055: Roll underling 0.2.1 release
    * Bug #1871: underling_bench -f help message misleading
    * Bug #1872: Typo in underling_bench: "Unable to malloc 1.91 GB bytes on rank 1"
    * underling.h did not include visibility.h causing broken builds
    * underling.hpp and underling_fftw.hpp

Pulled in newest gnulib updates.


What's new in underling 0.2.0
-----------------------------

Updates to support and take advantage of FFTW 3.3-beta1:

    * FFTW_DESTROY_INPUT now used on out-of-place transposes which allows
      greater plan search space and potentially faster execution.  Was
      not used in 0.1.0 due to FFTW 3.3alpha1 deadlock problems.

    * Use MPI new array execute interface appearing in 3.3-beta1.

Added new UNDERLING_TRANSPOSE_NONE flag when parallel decomposition is of
interest but one does not want to plan any transposes.

Static libraries built by default (when possible).

Libtool libraries now contain FFTW prerequisites and utilities are installed
with appropriate RPATH information.

Pulled in newest gnulib updates.
