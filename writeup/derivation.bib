@article{Zang1991Rotation,
    abstract = {A variety of numerical simulations of transition and turbulence in incompressible flow are presented to compare the commonly used rotation form with the skew-symmetric (and other) forms of the nonlinear terms. The results indicate that the rotation form is much less accurate than the other forms for spectral algorithms which include aliasing errors. For de-aliased methods the difference is minimal.},

@article{Kwok2001,
    abstract = {Resolution properties of B-spline and compact finite difference
schemes are compared using Fourier analysis in periodic domains, and tests
based on solution of the wave and heat equations in finite domains, with
uniform and nonuniform grids. Results show that compact finite difference
schemes have a higher convergence rate and in some cases better resolution.
However, B-spline schemes have a more straightforward and robust formulation,
particularly near boundaries on nonuniform meshes.},
